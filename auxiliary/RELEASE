This procedure involves both the Wiki Monkey [client] and the wiki-snake
[server].

Prechecks:
* [client|server] Ensure that no backward-incompatible configuration
  changes have been made;
* [client|server] Make sure to be on the 'develop' branch, which in
  turn is on the correct commit to be released;
* [client|server] Search for references to the current/previous version number
  and update them
* [client] Update the Node dependencies
* [server] Update the virtual environment dependencies and requirements.txt
* [client] The following steps assume that the update_check_branch option is
  set to 'develop' and the test User in the wiki is loading the latest script
  from the remote repository

Repeat the following block increasing # until everything works:
* [client] Create and checkout a 'v5.x.x-rc#' branch
  Do not omit the "-rc#" suffix (or similar) in order to prevent CDN services
  from caching the wrong version of the files in case further changes are
  needed
* [client] Run `./tasks.js build -v 5.x.x-rc#`
  Do *not* prepend the 'v' here to the version number
* [client] Commit
* [client] Reset the develop branch to the new rc# branch
* [client] Push the develop and rc# branches to the remote repository
* [client] Test that the automated upgrade works
  (possibly delete the 'WikiMonkey-last-update-check' key in the localStorage)
* [client] Test the application at least in Firefox and Chromium
  Also make sure to check the effects of any changes to the configuration
  object

On the server:
* [server] Change version numbers to 5.x.x-rc# (or 5.x.x_rc#)
* [server] Generate PyPI package (setup.py)
* [server] Update PKGBUILD's sha256sums
* [server] Use the local PyPI package to generate the Pacman package (makepkg)
* [server] Install and test the server package

If everything works:
* [client] Reset 'develop' to the commit before the working rc# branch was
  built
* [client] Checkout 'develop'
* [client] Run `./tasks.js build -v 5.x.x`
* [server] Change version numbers to 5.x.x
* [client|server] Commit and tag with the v5.x.x version number
* [client|server] Merge 'develop' into 'master'
* [client] Remove the rc# branches, also remotely
  To delete a remote branch: `git push origin :tmpbranch`
   or `git push origin :refs/heads/tmpbranch`

Release:
* [client|server] Update the GitHub wiki (also update version numbers in
  examples)
* [client|server] Check that the milestone is closed on GitHub
* [server] Publish on PyPI (twine)
* [server] Publish on AUR
* [client|server] Push 'master', 'develop' and the new tag to origin
* [client] Publish on npm
