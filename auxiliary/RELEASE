Prechecks
* Ensure that no backward-incompatible configuration changes have been made
* Make sure to be on the 'develop' branch, which in turn is on the correct
  commit to be released
  The following steps assume that the update_check_branch option is set to
  'develop' and the test User in the wiki is loading the latest script from the
  remote repository

Repeat the following block increasing # until everything works
* Create and checkout a 'v4.x.x-rc#' branch
  Do not omit the "-rc#" suffix (or similar) in order to prevent CDN services
  from caching the wrong version of the files in case further changes are
  needed
* Run `cake -v 4.x.x-rc# build`
  Do *not* prepend the 'v' here to the version number
* Commit
* Reset the develop branch to the new rc# branch
* Push the develop and rc# branches to the remote repository
* Test that the automated upgrade works
  (possibly delete the 'WikiMonkey-last-update-check' key in the localStorage)
* Test the application at least in Firefox and Chromium
  Also make sure to check the effects of any changes to the configuration
  object

If everything works
* Reset 'develop' to the commit before the working rc# branch was built
* Checkout 'develop'
* Run `cake -v 4.x.x build`
* Commit and tag with the v4.x.x version number
* Remove the rc# branches, also remotely
  To delete a remote branch: `git push origin :tmpbranch`
   or `git push origin :refs/heads/tmpbranch`
* Merge 'develop' into 'master'

* Update the GitHub wiki (also update version numbers in examples)
* Check that the milestone is closed on GitHub
* Push 'master', 'develop' and the new tag to origin
* Publish on npm
